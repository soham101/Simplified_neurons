## Simplified_neurons

<pre>
Hello,<br>I am back with a another blast. Here is the neural net I have hard coded.I have <br>used following libraries:
    Pandas:         For creation and manipulation of dataframes.
    Numpy:          For playing with matrices.
    Scikit-Learn:   For train-test split and applying other operations on datasets
    Matplotlib:     For plotting and other graphical operations.
I have implemented this on iris dataset.Do have a look.
